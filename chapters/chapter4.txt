2020 – Grade 10

Once again, there was the unfortunate reality of having to accept that Tumelo had failed Grade 9. Tumiso passed to Grade 9, Clement passed to Grade 10 but was in a different stream, and only DK and I ended up in the same science class. We were still friends, but since he wasn’t that extroverted, we always needed someone to bridge the gap. Still, we were cool—if we ever locked eyes, we knew the bond was there.

On the other side 😮‍💨, Anathi, Gong, and Moja also failed 🫠. School was hard, especially that year, but it is what it is.

😂 Funny story: on the first day in the science class, there were like 90 of us. The principal came in and said, “No, this can’t be possible—there are too many of you!” He gave us a lecture on how hard Pure Math, Physical Science, and Life Sciences were, but still no one left. He told us anyone could leave anytime though. Then our math teacher came—the only teacher who showed up that day—and gave us homework right away 😂😂.

The next day, when we came back, only about 40 people showed up. All the others had left because of one math homework 😂😭. The real number was probably closer to 39 or 37, because I was sitting alone at my desk (and each desk was meant for two people). That’s how the class really started.

After the first week, a new girl came—her name was Agisanang Machaba. A beautiful, smart girl who only spoke English (quite amusing to me at the time). She sat at the back with someone. Apparently, she was from a private school in Polokwane called Northern Academy. I wasn’t sure why she left there to come here, but she did.

Another week passed, and then one day, she came to sit at my desk. I didn’t say anything—not even greetings or ask why she was there. I thought maybe she just wanted a front-row seat to copy notes (she wore glasses). But the next morning, when I arrived, there was another chair pulled up to my desk. I ignored it, but when she came, she sat there. I was like, “Huh? What? 😂 What do you want? Go away.” But she just greeted me, and I greeted back. She said she didn’t like sitting at the back and wanted to sit with me since I was in front 😎✌️. I said okay. ... 😌you must want to see how it was right .. I got you 😎 . this is us after a few of her sitting with me (Press 👉 https://i.ibb.co/0j35TGVm/1757869861543.png ).a genuine smile from me 😂...

We started talking, and I began to like her. FYI 🙂 she was the most beautiful girl in the school( her currently https://i.ibb.co/B2r9NnT9/In-Shot-20250915-134027572.png )—not just smart but stunning. Suddenly, I started getting attention too because people thought we were dating. She didn’t mind people assuming, and she didn’t mind being with me during breaks, so yeah—that was my first friendship with a girl. Agi called me JJ 🙂, and Grade 10 was basically just me and Agi… plus a bunch of jealous boys 😹✌️😎.

Oh, and I also 😂 relaxed my hair. It grew so big that when it was windy, it blew side to side. That brought me even more attention—you could spot me from far away. In class though, I had to hide it under my hood because there was no way that was going to be allowed.

My Physical Science teacher at the time was Ma’am Thado 🫂, a young, new teacher who really understood physics. Obviously, she became my favorite ❤️. We had a good relationship—if I answered her questions, I could get away with almost anything 😌. One day during break, she saw me without my hood and said, “Onyako retxoxa wena” 😂 then walked off. Nice life ❤️.

And Agi? She was the first person to braid my hair—just two lines 🤝✌️.

That’s about all the significant stuff that happened in 2020. Well, there was the pandemic, so not much else went on. But yeah—I passed Grade 10 🫂❤️.

At that time, my mom decided to move us to Polokwane, Kwena Moloto 3, which is a neighboring township to Seshego 🫂. I was to start Grade 11 at a new school in town called Flora Park Comprehensive High School—right across from another school, Northern Academy (yes, Agi’s old school) press 👉 https://i.ibb.co/Xkddtj2r/Screenshot-20250913-003309.png .

😪and this year would also be the year my uncle passed away, still remember it quite well . I was sitting outside with my Grandma when she got the news(from the mutuary I assume) and she told me 🫠am not really sure what emotions I was feeling back then but am sure they weren't pleasant, especially when a very big part of me blamed myself for his death . he had given me task of finding a way to make money using my capabilities with that he left to go find work or anything you can do . and days before he was pronounced death he texted me on Facebook asking me if I had find anyway of making money of which I said no ,🥲and my conscious believes that if I had said yes then he would have returned home and wouldn't have been killed ...but yeah we can't change the past I've learned to live with that and here I am 😅 sometimes I even forgot but my PayPal account is in his names so I get reminded everytime I get a PayPal payment for those capabilities he was talking about.(I use his details bcz I wasn't old enough to create my own PayPal account at that time).. 🫂❤️

2021 – Grade 11

First day of school there, my mom came with me 🫠, but at the gate they said, “Nah, he’s old enough.” 😌 My face was like, “Yeah, I’m old enough mom, go home 🙂.” But in my head, I was panicking: WTF, I’m going to get lost. Why is this school so big? How will I get home? (press 👉 https://i.ibb.co/6cPdzcHQ/Screenshot-20250913-003140.png )

Anyway, my mom left, and I went in. A teacher asked if I was new. I said yes, and he told me I’d be cutting my hair soon 😔😂. Threats at first sight 😭😂.

I went to where I assumed assembly was. It was full, so I walked to the end of one of the lines. Tell me why the moment I got there, the line started moving 😭. I just followed. When we were away from everyone else, I asked the guy in front of me (who turned out to be Moeketsi, a future friend) what grade this was. He said Grade 11. (Thank God 😭😂).

Then I asked if this stream had Physics. He said yes. (Hallelujah, praise the Lord 😭😂). Then I asked if it had Life Sciences. He said no. (I’ve found heaven 😂😭). I didn’t even know what this stream was, but I knew it was destiny 😌❤️.

For like 2 weeks, I was just attending without knowing what was going on.they had previously given us drawing boards and one day they needed them. I left mine at home—cz in my mind there no way I was expected to carry that big thing to school 😂. So I was just sitting there boardless 🙂. After a while, I understood the concept: I was in the technical stream.

Here too, I had a nice relationship with my Physics teacher, Mr. Bopape 😹. A scary man, but I was by far the best Physics student in class, maybe even top 4 in the school. That meant I could do whatever I wanted as long as I answered his questions.

One day he caught me using my phone. Normally, he’d confiscate phones for months. But since it was me, he gave it back the same day after school 🫂🌹.

That was school life. Oh, and there was this girl named Given 🙂🔥. Her aura was insane. I honestly thought I was in class with an actress or celebrity—she was that beautiful.and No one could argue. But I couldn’t even look at her properly, let alone talk to her 🙂.

Friendships and Relationships

About 6 months into the year, I found out one of my classmates lived just one street away from me. His name was Thabo Mooi, a very problematic dude 😅. After my mom found out, I started going to school with him in his mom’s car instead of taking two taxis. Coming back, we still used taxis, but sometimes we walked part of the way to save money 😮‍💨. By the time we got home, our legs were dead.

Thabo introduced me to everyone—Hope (a beautiful, smart girl), Moeketsi (tall, mature), John (big, friendly, but intimidating), Maja (the joker), and many more. Basically, I had relationships with all my classmates because we were such a small group (about 30).

He also introduced me to girls and taught me things—like walking with them, inviting them home, etc.

One day he set me up with a girl named Happiness 😅. At first, I thought I was just third-wheeling their connection, but no—he was connecting me with her. Every day he made the conversations about me and her, and eventually, he left us to talk.(she lived close to our area so we used the same taxi) n one day Thabo asked her get off at our drop off location and he would accompany her home , Ahh jiki jiki Thabo is throwing complaints about heh heh ,dogs , mother , dishes, chores and Thabo is a very problematic good talker so some way somehow he convinced me to walk her home.i couldn't argues with him 😹he was that good at talking so yeah I agree to accompany her home and it was nice n I also found out that day that she likes me 😮‍💨 anyway When we got closer to her house , she hugged me and leaned in closer to me and just waited 😔N then I knew she was waiting for that other thing coupls do that I haven't done yet which is kissing 😭. I could barely handle the hug! She tried, I froze. She asked if I didn’t want it, I said, “Nah, I don’t mind.” so She kissed me😹 🫂.

That was my first kiss 🙂. Imagine—Grade 11, first kiss.N Yes, I got a boner 😂. I left as soon as I could. And technically, she became my first girlfriend 🌹🫂. but Eventually, it faded from relationship to friendship,with that one kiss.. but we were still fine.

Later, I even dated two girls at the same time 😎—Kelly and Tumelo. They came to me, John, and Maja during break one day(Thabo and the others walk too much during break so I just prefer to chill with John n Maja) and asked for my cold drink 😹.I almost choked but yes I gave it to them n they drank and wanted to return it n I said no it's fine keep it 🤭 oh yes 🤭 oh yes ..and again Out of nowhere, I asked Kelly for her number(most embarrassing most of my life I talked before thinking) ,but to my surprise not only did Kelly give me her number but all of them gave me theirs  😎(how cool was that ).and after a few days  I told Kelly and Tumelo I loved them, and guess what , both said yes they loved me too. and They didn’t mind sharing me! It wasn’t deep—just hugs, “I love yous,” and attention at school—but it was fun. Even Thabo was impressed 🤭. Eventually, that too faded back into friendship.

Back home, my mom introduced me to Ishmael, another teen my age in the area. We clicked immediately—as we both loved the same music, science, tech, and anime 💪. I introduced him to Thabo, and soon we were a trio going out taking walks n playing soccer. Later, Thabo introduced us to another Thabo (a taller one, homeschooled). We’d walk, play soccer, and eventually spend 70% of our time at tall Thabo’s place playing Monopoly 😂. Good times.

Back to School – Girls Again

At school, I started connecting more with classmates—even with Given and Kamo, the two most beautiful girls in school 🤭. Somehow, I built a decent relationship with both.

Eventually, I focused on Kamo (view Kamo 👉 https://i.ibb.co/XZHM9STP/In-Shot-20250916-135334397.png ). Naturally🙄💪, we reached a dating stage 😌, and soon we were officially a couple. Life was nice 😹.we were both a bit introverted so I still hadn’t hugged/kissed her . Thabo didn’t like that, so one day after school,when we were heading to the taxi he called her over and said, “No! you guys need to Show us you’re dating—hold hands, hug, kiss, something!” 😭.

a few people started watching us n gathering. but luckily Kamo made the smart move: she hugged me 🫂so that we can go home cz Thabo was not letting us go until we did something 😹That’s how problematic Thabo was 🤧. Still, our relationship continued. Even Mr. Bopape liked it.🤧 But good things end—one day, do on a random day Kamo texted me that we should break up. (My first heartbreak 😂).

obviously I had to ask why and she didn't want to tell me but I kept insisting and She said it was because our grades were dropping. I didn’t believe her, but I accepted. Later on I still tried to get a better answer and I got her to admit that someone had threatened her to stop dating me 🫠.(imagine 😪).I couldn’t get more details, so I understood. We stayed friends.

(NB: at this point I was hoeing 🙂 I only now realise how many girls I dated in one year 🙂){but am still pure right 😔I mean 3 or 4 hugs plus 1 kids😔).......

and Then came Retha—a feisty girl. Most of our conversations happened over the holidays, on the phone. We would normally talked about sexual stuff (a first for me)but it was nice .we weren't dating I think 🫠but we did we the I love you phrase 🤔so I guess we were dating so yeah Then jiki jiki—she showed me her boobs 😶. Then she saw my abs and prints 😶. Then we went to the extremes cz she showed me her vagina 🙂and that was the first time I saw one that belonged to someone I know 😔it was the most pleasing moment of my life❤️😔 could look at it all day n black girls have a much more beautiful vagina than those white chicks 🙂‍↔️on porn vids🤭. and she wasn’t shy—sending videos, not just pics.

That’s when I first masturbated. and the first time the White stuff came out 😹, and I was scared but it felt good very good. I did it a few more times to her videos 😮‍💨. We even talked about doing the deed at school if ever there's a chance. But before ethe schools opens the spark started to fade and when school opened, our connection was too vague for us to even met up . By the time we saw each other, it was like nothing happened. I don’t even remember how we got each other’s numbers.

And just like that, I was single again 🫂❤️.

To give you a bit of insight about my class:

I was in Grade 11C, of which the class “C” had a reputation of being the most problematic class in Flora Park Comprehensive High School (FC). And even that year, which was my first year, it was still classified that way 🫂. Even to a point where our English teacher, Ma'am Rakgadi, wanted to remove that “C” and give us another letter 😹. Which somehow failed, and we didn't have a problem with that “C,” so yeah, we kept it.

Now for the individuals that make up the class:

Hope ( https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSHn9wceUvojB-Y6ySx/ genius of the class, beautiful girl)

Given (the boy, also a genius)

Lesedi (matured, smart)

Chics (Lesedi’s best friend and also very smart)

Kamo (beautiful girl and decently smart)

Judith (Kamo's friend and just above-average smart)


A friend group of girls:

Grace: the most feared girl

Unathi: tall, light-skinned girl

Lebo: cool girl

Tshego: can’t really explain her, but she’s definitely not shy at all

Joyce: the calm and collected one


Then comes Thabo’s group, which basically included all the boys:
Me, John (intimidating), Maja (jokes), Moekets (matured), Lockets (ladies’ boy), Ghana (he owes me money), Langa (funny), Phaladi (view phaladi 👉https://i.ibb.co/JjhBTFrg/1758024961599.png ) (my respected friend—I used to help him a lot as he was a bit older and struggling with some subjects, and he was putting in the work so I respect him 🤝🙂‍↔️. He may have also been a bit rich), Kgops (Thabo's best friend).

Then there was another group (Matome and Nkuna).

Then there was Given—she didn't really have a special favorite, she'd just be anywhere she wanted 🫂.

I may have not mentioned 2 or 3 people 🤧, but that was our class 🫂. Everyone had a part.

Like how Grace would always lead the songs we would sing in the morning for prayer, and she had a very beautiful voice (regardless of her being very aggressive and intimidating). 😂 Same goes for Tshego with her confidence, as one day Grace didn't come and we needed someone to lead. She took the job 😭, but she was so bad even I couldn't hold my laughter 🫂. But because of the amount of confidence she had in herself 😹💪, she continued to sing very loudly until we finished laughing, and then we joined her and we had a beautiful prayer 🙃.

Oh yeah, 2021 is also the year my stepfather was introduced in my life (though after seeing him, I could remember seeing his face a few times in Polokwane on my way to Seshego and back to Indermark during maybe 2019). But I formally knew him in 2021. He came and lived with us, everything was good, and then we got to see his kid, which was Tsatsi, and visit his family and got to know them as well ❤️. All good.

And that’s everything significant that happened that year. And I passed Grade 11

also created a new Facebook account (press👉 https://www.facebook.com/jonas.lefa.503 )

n take a lot at Thabo doesn't he just look suspicious 🤧( https://i.ibb.co/9kkB0TyK/1758024506185.png )
