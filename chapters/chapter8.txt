Now 2025

A very sad start 😅 ‘cause university was still at rejected/space constraints/no response. Then jiki jiki NMU was like “you have been accepted” 😹. Ran to tell my Mom and she was like hip hip hooray 😹 and so was my dad, but I told them where NMU was located and they were like, “so did any other university respond?” 😹 and I said no. And to be honest even I wasn’t enthusiastic about this NMU thing ‘cause why is it so far? For a couple of days we went to TUT and UL in person to inquire and apply. We even got someone who previously worked at TUT and is now working at UL to assist us but regardless they didn’t respond 😅. So then it was evident that it was either NMU or another gap year 😹.

A few weeks before the time they said I should be at NMU, then is when we confirmed that I was coming here 😌. Then the excitement kicked up. They were discussing which is the most efficient relative to the price between bus, car, and plane. Plane was out of the picture because of the price and how new and unknown the location I was going to was. My Mom was like, “oh hell yes, I’m going with you” 🤧 so the price would have been a lot knowing she’d have to return back after a few days. So it was either car or bus 😮‍💨 which eventually was the bus. So we booked and stuff and started preparing. My Mom was adding stuff and stuff in my bag which ended up being bags 🤧.

Oh yeah, I had also forgotten to book accommodation 😅 so we can say that was one reason my Mom came with me ‘cause 😹 where tf am I going, where will I stay etc 😹. So we came around early February. After getting off the bus terminal at PE I could just feel I am far from home(just looking at this made me uneasy https://i.ibb.co/pBLNCLc1/In-Shot-20250916-135738110.png ). Mind you, we didn’t even know where we were going and NMU wasn’t making it easy ‘cause there are 5 different campuses (South, North, 2nd Ave, Ocean, and George campus). At the time we had no idea what was what so we just searched NMU on Bolt which gave us South Campus and it happened to be a walkable distance away from SSV (a res for other students but also an enquiry point for those of us with res-related issues).

So after getting off at South Campus and asking around, they directed us to SSV where we were again confused ‘cause it was just packed. My Mom just so happened to go to the line that was specifically for my need (looking for a res and with an NSFAS status of provisionally accepted). Then I just had to confirm I was registered to NMU, now that my NSFAS status is provisionally accepted. Then I was told to wait in a taxi for other students like me, that included my roommate who entered the taxi later on, and we were driven to Castle House Residence 😮‍💨. They showed us the rooms and had us fill a few forms and that was it 🫂. I was able to find a place to sleep on the very same day I got here and my Mom was given a temporary room as she had to leave after a day.

We unpacked and settled in and it was time to go buy stuff. We went with my Mom 🤧 and my roommate (Mbasa) was the one to ask me and my Mom if we could share the groceries and so we did 🫂. Then the day I accompanied my Mom to the bus terminal and she left 😹❤️. So I was officially alone, 1800 km away from home. It felt heavy but nice 🙃✅.

😹 The first time we went to school we didn’t know that the shuttles at our stop go mainly to South Campus (the main campus). Along the way they would need to take a detour to 2nd Ave Campus which is my campus 😹 but you had to say “2nd Ave” somewhere along the ride for them to take that detour. So we were just quiet ‘til we got to South Campus and people got off 😹. We also got off. Then after some time we checked our map and realized that no man 😹😂😭 this isn’t where we should be and our class was a 51-minute walk away. We were also getting late as it was around 07:00 and our class was at 7:45.

So we literally ran 😹, which was useless ‘cause we made it just at 7:45 but we couldn’t find our classes 😂. Not until maybe 8:30 did we find them, and at that time only 15 minutes were left 😹. Can’t wait to see the confused first years in 2026 🤭❤️ asking us seniors for directions.

But yeah, in general 🙃 everything was good. I got familiar with my classes, I made friends in the first few days 😂 which was definitely unexpected of me 🤭❤️. So hooray to that. Two girls Inga and Abongile, and two boys Fire and Tonic including Mbasa (roommate) and his friend Zinande. I had/have 😅 a total of 6 people I can talk to 🙃.

😗 Well I can’t forget about you 🙃. You were also a very significant figure in my… (I wonder why that is in the past, lemme correct myself) you ARE a very significant figure in my life. Your presence influences so much in me, without it something just isn’t right. I felt that void during our break 🥲. My pride wanted me to accept that she is gone but I just couldn’t, and I’m very pleased with my decision ‘cause look at us now 🙃❤️ all in love and stuff 🤭.

😹 Oh yeah here I was going to poke your emotions a bit and say something like: “how memorable would it be that on our anniversary, instead of the everyday scenario of hubby showing me his sugar cane, this time we have wifey show her spancanca to emphasize the significance of our anniversary” 😹. But you already TECHNICALLY agreed to show it to me later on 🤭❤️ so there’s no need to persuade you anymore. And if you are really intending on showing 😹 then think long and hard about the fact that you will be showing someone you’ve never met before your private parts, and the only reason is just ‘cause it would please and make him happy 🙃. Even if you don’t show me, nothing much will change 🙃. I’d still love you as much as I ever have.

Speaking about loving you, you must wonder what my intentions are with you.
Well,

1. I want to see you happy and smiling even if it involves me suffering (theoretically speaking, I know you wouldn’t want me to suffer). But yeah, my main goal is your happiness. I feel happy myself just knowing you are okay.


2. Is to one day bring you over to come live with me, so I can better take care of you and give you a bit of rest from everything you may have been experiencing 🙃 until I get lazy 🙂‍↔️. I’d give you the rest, peace, and love ❤️. I’ll give you that piggyback ride I promised 🫂, buy matching PJs, and MAYBE take you out 🙃. Then when I start to get lazy you’ll take over (🙂‍↔️ askies in advance for getting lazy) and take care of me while I do my final pushes in life so that I can buy you that welcome gift ❤️.


3. Is to have you bear our children 😮‍💨 when the time is right… a boy and 2 girls 🫢 if we can. I want a nice little family 😌❤️, the boy taking after me, one girl taking after you, and the other girl being a combination of me and you. And I understand a family in a sense means marriage, so I’m open for that as well 🤭 as long as there aren’t that many people. Then I’m looking forward to marrying you 🙃.


4. 🫢 Well my intentions can’t all be that beautiful… so yeah I do intend to 🤭 make love with you, for the fact that you look as if it will give me an abnormal amount of pleasure to do it 😮‍💨. And also 🙂‍↔️ I’d be honored to have my virginity taken by someone like you 🤭. So I’ll wait. And you’re a virgin too 😅 not sure what honor there is to having me take it away from you, but it is what it is 🫢. And did you know I’d let you have intercourse with someone else just to open your hoohaa a lil bit so that I don’t risk hurting you 🥲? 😪 I know I’m looking forward to it, but I’m also scared of how I might not do things right. But I believe I can give you a wonderful time so I’ll just go with that ❤️.


5. Boobs. I would very much like to poke your boobs 🙂🫂❤️, and your hoohaa too if you’re that allowing 😹 which I know you’re not.


6. You sometimes say you fear us growing apart, but to be honest I’m scared that you will leave me one day 🥲. It terrifies me 😹, especially when I do D-TECH stuff that you explicitly say it’s okay for me to do but I still feel guilty. But I’m adjusting 😹. So please don’t leave me ❤️. And that’s my 6th intent: for you to understand my love for you so that you don’t have any reason to leave.



There’s more, but I’ll cut it at those 6 for now 🫂.

And with that I conclude my anniversary gift for you ❤️. I hope you enjoyed everything 🙃. Stay safe, healthy and well ❤️. 🙃 I love you… and that comes from the deepest depths of my heart ❤️.

Ohh and 🙃 hello 👋 Owami, my gentle flame ❤️ how are you today 🙃❤️
