2023

We had previously spent Christmas and New Year at Moria 🫂❤️, so it was quite pleasing. It was a very peaceful time, and regardless of the tens of thousands of people there, it wasn’t that bad. We stayed for about a week or two. The fireworks there are always a sight to behold ❤️.

After that we went back, spent January just sitting at home, and I got my statement later that month. I had already known it’s by default a bachelor, I was only worried about what kind of bachelor it would be.

And as I assumed, my statement was good if we excluded Math 😪. So I just decided not to apply and instead upgrade my Math… and Physics (just for the fun of it). So I did that and applied for the rewrite in June 🫂.

I started studying through the first 2 months which is also when my step father brought tsatsi to come live with us , and on the 3rd I went to Indermark, my grandparents’ place, for a bit more peace and quiet so I could study more and better.

In that time I also began to talk to one of the girls I previously had a talking stage with in the previous years. I had never even seen her in person before, just talked on Facebook 😅. Not sure why, but after Grade 12 I could better and easier face people, especially if I knew they were still in school. So I began to walk a bit further from the corner at home when Michael would come by.

So I was also able to go to a soccer event a few streets away from my home, which is where I met that girl for the first time (Mosima). We talked 🤭, and with my newly found confidence I got us into a relationship quite quickly. So yeah, I was dating her, and it would either be I go out for Michael or her (NB: she would travel to my house’s street and I’d come out to a nearby forest — 😹 more of a natural park but yeah).

The sex talk was there, but we met for a week and nothing happened except kisses. And just so you know, I didn’t and don’t like them… {and bcz of my respect to you I won’t go into detail, but for the sake of you knowing everything I’ll say just that point}… [🙂 but maybe I should cz I mean if you get jealous that means you’d want us to do more than what I did with her 🙂✌️… nice (so on detail it is) {partially}].

So one day after we were about to part ways 🤧, I slid my hand in her pants and did you-know-what with my finger (and that would be the first time I’d touched a female private part). So yeah, that… and it continued to happen on most, if not all, of our meetups from there 😮‍💨.

And one day she also made the move and gave me my first BJ 😪. Mesmerizing, that I will say. Though she stopped just before I could cum, which I’m glad cz I didn’t know how to handle that issue. From then we started doing those things to each other, and I even cummed for the first time in the presence of her. Mesmerizing 🙂‍↕️.

Oh yeah, I actually masturbated before leaving so that the BJ lasts longer 😅. And one day, idk where the confidence came from, but I went without releasing the first cum and I ended up cumming faster than anticipated 🫂. She ate a bit 😂, and for your own knowledge, she didn’t seem to like it (🙂‍↔️ but you’re different, right? … Yes 🙂‍↔️🫂).

We met up about once or twice a week as I needed most of the time to study. Then around June 😹 — oh, I thought I was writing my first test at a later date. One day I received a call from my friend who I was supposed to write the test with saying, “Where are you? We are about to enter the exam site.” Fear struck me 😂, cz I was literally 3 or more hours away from the exact site, nevermind the money I would need in that instance. So I just missed my first exam, which was Paper 1 of Math 🤧.

I later left and managed to write Paper 2 and Paper 1 & 2 of Physics 🙂. When the results came, only my Physics marks were present. For Math it was just XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. I guess they don’t record anything if you only write one paper 😔. So I now had to reapply for a rewrite in November, which I did — this time only for Math, cz Physics I had improved, but I no longer had the energy to study something I already knew.

So I did that and went back to Indermark. Not sure if I went back because of the sexual activities I was experiencing with her or because I understood that being there I had a lot more time to study. But yeah, while there I did continue, with 85% of my time being at home, of that 85, 50% being studying.

That other 15% I’d be either with Michael or Mosima (which we still did everything). To a point where I managed to have her come to my house 😮‍💨. Got to my room, she got naked, while we were getting into position she asked, “Are you wearing protection?” I said no. Then she asked if I wear it 🤧. I did, and then we tried 🙂✌️. And yes, you guessed it… your sugar cane here didn’t go on. Didn’t even feel like I was at the right place 😂. Not sure if it’s just cz of how small the hole is, but it just felt like I was hitting a wall 🙂‍↔️.

So I investigated with my fingers (in that moment I used 3, even though normally she would take 1, and during special moments she could take 2). So I was quite confident the hole was there 😂🙂‍↔️. Mara still it didn’t go on 😭, till she said, “No, I can’t do this” 🙂‍↔️.

Then she left and went outside, not sure for what, but she sat behind my house catching air of some sort. After like an hour, she came back, climbed on me and was sliding her clit (probably… never saw it) on my cane (with the protection on), then proceeded to have the loudest moaning she’s ever had 🤧. I was just waiting for her to get off cz during that I didn’t feel anything. So I was just there 😪.

But yeah, some time she got off, and we wore our clothes and she went home 🤧.

Idk what that did to her, but from there she started to get too obsessed with me — wanting to meet me every day, wanting to see my Facebook and WhatsApp content, etc, which I did not like. Unfortunately, at that time school was my main priority, so if need be, I was and would just break up with her.

And things got worse. Now she used my lil sister’s pics on her WhatsApp and Facebook profiles, even changed her Facebook name to “Pretty’s Hun.” That settled it for me. I was done with her. Told her to “f off.”

But that stubborn bastard went and logged into all my Facebook accounts 😭 (I never imagined my Facebook account would be a target for anyone considering the type of reputation I had, so my passwords were all “lefalefalefa” 😂). So yeah, she blocked every single girl on the accounts, texted some to stop talking to me, etc.

I got the accounts back after a while, and now she had already found the other girls I was talking to (just normal conversation, not talking stage or relationship). One was a lesbian 🙂. Jiki jiki I hear Michael tell me that there was a fight at school over me between Mosima and that lesbian 😹 (amusing).

Not much I could do bcz I didn’t want to talk to Mosima anymore. I even blocked her everywhere, but I wanted to talk to that lesbian cz I caused the problems for her. So we met up, and somehow Mosima found out and started problems again, even coming to my gate — of which I had to go see her cz I couldn’t allow her to enter my home and cause issues 🤧.

We talked for a bit, and to be honest, I was just amazed by the magnitude of the things she was doing just to be with me, regardless of me directly telling her I didn’t want her anymore 🫠. For a day or two I thought maybe I should give her a second chance. So I agreed to meet her again, which started well (🫢 even got my last BJ).

But towards the end my phone rang (it was my grandpa asking if I was far from home and that he needed me for something). Idk how the call sounded like to her, but I assume it wasn’t evident it was my grandpa. She asked who that was, I told her, and obviously she didn’t believe me.

Again I received a text on WhatsApp — also didn’t make things better cz she again said, “Lemme see who that is” 🤧. I did not find being interrogated to my liking, so I decided that now it’s over, I’m not giving her another chance.

I tried to leave, she stopped, started shouting, saying weird stuff like she wants to give me a baby, etc. I forced my way through and left 🙂‍↕️.

Then from there random people started texting me on WhatsApp saying, “Mosima is crying, plz unblock her, she wants to tell you something.” For months this happened. I ignored most, but once or twice I’d give in cz I can’t be angry at a person forever. But when I unblocked her the normal talk would last a day or two, then I’d block her again ( some of the people who knew me that she was texting on Facebook https://i.ibb.co/XxWKMvFy/IMG-20240713-WA0026.png  & https://i.ibb.co/YmK8HS8/IMG-20240621-WA0006.png. )😮‍💨.

One time I unblocked her, I was showered by her nudes. I felt nothing but pity 🥲 cz of the lengths she was going. So I gave it a bit more effort that time, but regardless, a few weeks went by and it was the same, and I blocked her again. From then I blocked everyone who texted me about her without talking to them 😪.

She did create a new Facebook account and threatened to text my mom on Facebook and tell her about everything. I mized her 😪. And that was the beginning of the end of all the madness ❤️🫂.

😮‍💨 How wild was that 😌🔥❤️. And if you’re jealous then askies, and I hope we get to experience ten times more of the sexual activities I did with her ❤️🔥😌.

Now back to school: exam time came, I wrote all my papers 🫂, and I managed to improve my Math marks 💪.

Now that I think about it, not much happened that year. I only had the Mosima complications and studying.
