2024 
Last year 😮‍💨 my second gap year at the time I really really had nothing to do .I had already applied 😮‍💨 so I literally had to wait for a whole year for nothing as I could only go to university in 2025 so I mainly focus on D-TECH primary the dtech telegram channel and the dtech services YouTube channel 
All was well my audience was growing, a one man Telegram channel reach 1.7k subscriber is really something so good that Telegrm it self started to show ads on my channel so I started to get revenue and considering the tools I created and the Stu acc I was selling for a teen it was a entertaining enough life , plus I liked being viewed as a boss(preasx24) .. ohh and about the name preasx24 it's derived from my 😑😑 well it's priest and Prince 😑😑 wise and royalty 😑😑 x is just cool 😑😑 24 also sounded cool 😑😑 mix everything together and you get my alias  preasx24 💪😌 ..cool right 

Anyway while busy with my stuff on TELEGRAM I came I to contact with a man under the name  tech bytes(his telegram channel names droid Dec)of which he was very intelligent and my type of companion so we got to collaborate on something things and we even got to have our own combined Telegrm channel which was called Droid-TECH .. original it would have been tech droid but then my D-T wouldn't be included so we went with Droid tech . With that we did some tools together n that was that 

But I alter found out that he was carding (in simple terms it's to either create credit card details that look real and as if they have buy and use then to buy stuff online or to clone/steal credit card details from else where) so he was doing that and carding stuff of which I also got involved..where I created a website for him so he would just out photo of what he wanted to sell and the price( which would be 80% -90% cheaper than the actual price so we don't really use our own money so phone like the iPhone 15 and the Samsung s24 we sold at 1.5k to 3k and unbelievable as that is it seemed to work I got the customer and he did the carding and we would split the real money we received from the people buying . That carried on good for a bit until he was called to court bcz of a women saying he scammed her 😪not sure if it's was bcz the order didn't go as planned or what but the women ran to the police so he was called and unfortunately bcz of the nature of the allegation they had the authority to check his phone 😮‍💨which held thousands of credit card details 🤧 so new cases were built and we talked for a bit while he was waiting for trials that's how I know all this and jiki jiki he's offline for days I can't call or reach him and after a few weeks I reach out to someone else that was close to him and he explains that he had been arrested 🙂 a sentence of 5 years and it just so happens that before that two of my friends had already paid half of the money for there ones to a total of 2.8k if am not mistaken and cz tech bytes was out of the pics and I couldn't card myself I had no other choice but to refund them myself 😮‍💨and that is how I got my 2.8k debt 🫂❤️

😹Was terrific but I was paying them monthly 😪, sad me . And I had to work on the double on dtech cz I needed the cash I start giving free samples of other channels on Telegram and other platforms in hope that they'd get attached and buy sometimes which they did ❤️🫂 .. during this phrase of marketing 😹is when I stumbled upon you 🙃 my beautiful owami 🤭.. thou I won't lie at first I just treated you like a regular girl ( like oh hi  look another human 😹) but we talked regardless and I began to understand that you weren't just like the others , thou I couldn't explain it so I just continue to chat with him 🙃I also got to see your pics so I also knew you were beautiful ❤️ and that you had nice boobs 🤭. After sometime it was apparently that I had now hardcored you into a part of my daily routine cz I could go a day without talking to you then came days when I needed to talk to you so I can be okay 😹 regardless of that I probably still take a long time to actually say I love you 😹and you sure took your time to say it back 🙂‍↔️ . Dont recall much but And then ..and then it was that we were officially hubby and wifey and we continued to love each other more and more ❤️ . So much so that I was like this women deserves to see the pure me 🤭🙂‍↔️which happened to be me without clothes 💪which sure you got to see my abs first 🫂 then can the question..lefa was like owami do you want to see my sugar cane..owami was like what¿¡ ..lefa was like yes sugar cane.. owami was like why .. lefa was like just nje 🙂‍↔️ but guess what 🤧for some unknown unexplainable reason owami still said no 💪❤️I listened but I didn't give up 🫂I'd peaceful request to show it to her a few times whenever the mood felt okay ,🤧but she was consistent with the no's 🫠how Cruel 🙄

Anyway 🫂

Moving on to my applications both UL and UJ said space constrains 😪 thou of the 4 course UJ rejected me for one 🙂‍↔️ , then there was univen which did not say anything and Well as ump the just did respond just blank 😪 UFs responded but whatever I was accepted to had complications 😹I think this was that music course ... saying I have to go before school open to do a sort of audition 😹 so yeah I mized that and lastly there was tut not sure what was of it but yh those were what I assumed I applied for and no where going well so it seemed like another gap year 😹was coming so my Mom Began looking for private colleges or universities and even looking for internships 😮‍💨
