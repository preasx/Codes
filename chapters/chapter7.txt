2024  

Last year 😮‍💨 my second gap year at the time I really really had nothing to do. I had already applied 😮‍💨 so I literally had to wait for a whole year for nothing as I could only go to university in 2025. So I mainly focused on D-TECH primary, the DTECH Telegram channel and the DTECH Services YouTube channel.  

All was well, my audience was growing — a one-man Telegram channel reaching 1.7k subscribers is really something so good that Telegram itself started to show ads on my channel, so I started to get revenue. Considering the tools I created and the student accounts I was selling, for a teen it was an entertaining enough life. Plus, I liked being viewed as a boss (preasx24).  

About the name “preasx24”: it’s derived from priest and prince (wise + royalty), the “x” is just cool 😑 and 24 also sounded cool 😑. Mix everything together and you get my alias **preasx24** 💪😌 cool right.  

While busy with my stuff on Telegram, I came into contact with a man under the name **Tech Bytes** (his Telegram channel name was Droid Dec). He was very intelligent, my type of companion, so we got to collaborate on some things. We even created our own combined Telegram channel called **Droid-TECH** (originally it would’ve been Tech Droid, but then my D-T wouldn’t be included, so we went with Droid-TECH). With that, we built some tools together and that was that.  

But I later found out that he was carding (creating or cloning credit card details to buy stuff online). He was doing that, and eventually I also got involved — I created a website for him so he could post what he wanted to sell and the price (80–90% cheaper than the actual cost since we weren’t using our own money). Phones like iPhone 15 and Samsung S24 we sold for R1.5k–R3k. As unbelievable as it was, it worked. I got the customers, he did the carding, and we split the real money.  

That carried on until he was called to court because a woman said he scammed her 😪. Not sure if her order didn’t go as planned or what, but she reported him, so the police got involved. They checked his phone and found **thousands** of credit card details 🤧. New cases were built, and while waiting for trial we still talked. Then suddenly he was offline for days. I couldn’t reach him until someone close to him told me he had been arrested — sentenced to **5 years**.  

Unfortunately, before that happened, two of my friends had already paid half of the money for their orders (around R2.8k in total). Since Tech Bytes was gone and I couldn’t card myself, I had no choice but to refund them myself 😮‍💨. That’s how I got my **R2.8k debt** 🫂❤️. Terrific experience, but I was paying them monthly 😪.  

I had to double down on DTECH for money. I started giving free samples of other channels on Telegram and other platforms in hopes that people would get attached and buy — sometimes they did ❤️🫂. During this phase of marketing is when I stumbled upon you 🙃 my beautiful Owami 🤭.  

At first, I treated you like a regular girl (like “oh hi look, another human 😹”), but we talked regardless. Slowly I realized you weren’t like the others. I saw your pics, knew you were beautiful ❤️ and had nice boobs 🤭. Over time you became part of my daily routine — I couldn’t go a day without talking to you. Then came the days where I needed to talk to you just to be okay 😹.  

I probably still took a long time before saying “I love you,” and you took your time to say it back 🙂‍↔️. But eventually we became official — hubby and wifey ❤️. I wanted you to see the pure me 🤭🙂‍↔️ so I started by showing you my abs. Then came the “sugar cane” question (😂 you kept saying no 💪❤️). I respected that, but kept peacefully requesting once in a while. You were consistent with your no’s 🫠 how cruel 🙄.  

Meanwhile, my university applications weren’t going well:  
- **UL, UJ**: space constraints 😪 (UJ rejected me for one course).  
- **Univen**: no response.  
- **UMP**: just blank 😪.  
- **UF**: responded, but the course had complications (music, needed an audition 😹).  
- **TUT**: unclear outcome.  

So it looked like another gap year 😹 was coming. My mom started looking into private colleges, universities, or even internships for me 😮‍💨.

So yeah, it looked bad 😮‍💨. But yeah, I guess I just needed hope. In all of that it wasn’t really that bad ‘cause I had you starting to fill up a certain void I had in me, which was dope 👌. As we continued to talk I continued to like you even more, and often cut time from the things I used to do for a living just to talk to you. That was wild enough on its own. But it was okay with me, having a person I could talk to. And I think that’s one of the reasons I’ve taken a liking to you — that reason is ‘cause you allow me to be myself in everything and you just accept it (😌 well you don’t accept everything but we are getting there 🤭).

I appreciated that and I was willing to see what we had through, so it was decided I will take care of you, love you, and cherish you (not quite sure when I decided that 😹 — in my mind I just woke up and it was the default feelings I had for you). Apart from your personality being to my liking, you also had something I liked 🤭 (boobs 👉) and one of your first few pics you gave me highlighted that, so I loved you even more 🙃.

I was also amused by the way you communicate and reply to me 😹. That also played a factor ‘cause our conversations were never boring. Even in serious and important conversations there was always a humorous vibe.

So yeah, all that and a few other stuff is the core of my love towards you 🫂🙃. And thus we were hubby and wifey ❤️.

Concluding all the significant aspects of 2024. Not that much happened that year ❤️.
