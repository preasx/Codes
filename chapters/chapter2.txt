HIGH SCHOOL – GRADE 8 (2018)

A new start to a new life. Very intimidating atmosphere and a possibility of new friends and new experiences.

It was a normal start: new teachers, new environment, new people. But I was calm. Unfortunately, because of how many we were, we got split into 3 classes: A, B, and C. Sadly, Tumiso was placed in C while the rest of us were in A. That was hard because it was the beginning of the end of our group. NB: not our friendship, just our class group.

I met a new friend named Anathi, whose group included Moja and another one named Gong 😹. Very funny people. Anathi understood me a bit more, so we got attached. I started walking with him, which also made me get to know Moja and Gong better 😅.

We even played spin (not sure if you know it). To this day, I still believe Moja was cheating because he always won 😭. I’d lose all my money, but he’d then buy me something to eat during break 😂. But he didn’t always win — Gong was usually second, Anathi third, and I was fourth. Honestly, I was quite good myself. As long as those three weren’t there, I’d win 🌹.

Oh, and I got a few female companions too — girls who talked to me like a regular person (weird). Anyway, one day I got into some sort of argument with one of those girls. Suddenly people started chanting “Fight! Fight! Fight!” But nah… there I was, just pushing that girl, and she pushed me back. I was like, Bruh, come on, I don’t want to fight you. I don’t even know how we got here. Regardless of what people were saying (“coward” etc.), I just sat down, let her look down at me, and walked away 🙂. Took a big amount of pride to do that, but I did it.

A few weeks later, something else happened 😮‍💨🙂. Not necessarily proud of this. One day, Moja and I were playing around in the front desk when a girl walked by. Moja bumped into her. When she turned, she didn’t know who it was, so she just said, “What’s going on? Why did you bump into me?” I kept quiet because I didn’t do anything, and I thought Moja would just say “Sorry, it was me.” But nooo 😭😂. Instead, he said, “Jonas did it.”

Before I could react, that girl was all over me, saying, “Why you bumping into me?” in my face. I humbly said, “I didn’t do it,” thinking she’d just accept that and move on. But then Moja said, “Why are you backing down like that? Are you scared of her?” 😅

Because of my previous “fight” with a girl, that flipped a switch in my head. I pushed her 🙂‍↔️. Lord, did I start something 😂. That girl did not back down 😭. She came at me throwing hands. I was hunched down, so she kept hitting my back. It didn’t hurt much, so I just stayed like that until she finished.

But people were still saying “coward” etc., and I was getting annoyed. This girl wasn’t helping either because she wouldn’t stop hitting me. At some point, she hit my head, and I snapped. I stood straight and threw punches. Not even sure how many. The next thing I remember, she was standing still, looking me in the eyes, and the whole place went quiet. I walked past her and sat down. Then people started cheering again.

The next time I locked eyes with her was when she was being taken outside by other girls, bleeding 😔. A few minutes later, I was called to the office. I didn’t deny anything, nor did they care what she did first. I was reprimanded, but because of my grandpa’s reputation, the teacher didn’t call any parents.

NB: My grandpa is quite respected 🤭. He made the Mochebane surname decent in my village, and my uncle added to that reputation 😹. Adults respected us 🤭, bullies feared us, and my uncle had a real name in the streets 🫂.

Anyway, the bell rang, we went home, and that was that.

The next day, the girl didn’t come to school. Nor the day after. People started saying I had “unalived” her 😅. But on the third day, she returned, and things went back to normal. I never spoke to her again until exam time when she asked me for a Halls ❤️. I gave it to her, we both smiled a little, and that was that.

That was the main drama of Grade 8. Ohh, yeah — I also got my first phone, a Mobicel 😹. I created my Facebook account (Jonas Mochebane) and started texting random people and girls 😅… but it all ended in blue ticks. Around this time, I also got more into tech instead of just science. I started looking into hacks, free data, and did my first projects.

I spent most of my time in my room 😮‍💨, though I still watched Dragon Ball every day. My grandparents continued taking care of me, my little brother, and my uncle (their youngest son). I stayed indoors while Tebogo was always outside. He was the main connection between us and the outside world. He’d even forcefully turn off the TV so I’d come out and play 🤭.

He was very good at creating wire cars. His best creation was a car called “Michael Knight”, inspired by a show on SABC 3 about a talking car. A beautiful black car. Driving it was fun 😂. But Tebogo had anger issues 😹. One time the car wasn’t moving well, and he just smashed it into the ground after spending days making it.

We also built houses (don’t judge 😅). We made small bricks from mud, let them dry, dug foundations, and built them brick by brick with mud as plaster. We even built 2 storeys ✊ and wanted to go for 3. But even at 2, the angles weren’t straight 😹. You couldn’t put any more bricks. So we demolished it 😔.

Sometimes Tebogo called us outside to play. One day he suggested a “fun idea” — throwing rocks at each other 🤦. I don’t know why I agreed, but I did. Of course, he hit the jackpot: right on my forehead. I bled so much. I was more scared about how much blood I was losing than the actual injury. Then someone said I might have damaged my brain 😅. I was like, “Huh? What do you mean?”

And yes, you guessed it — they didn’t even take me to the hospital 😂. Just bandaged me up with spirit and left me to heal. Luckily, it was during the holidays, so I had time to recover. By the time school reopened, I was fine.

At this point, I still had zero relationships or interest in girls, though I noticed one or two gave me attention. I ignored it. My routine was simple: school, home, Facebook, a bit of studying, sleep, repeat.

Around this time, I also started getting recognition for my tech skills. I could create Freenet files (free data configs). That was very rare and impressive back then, so my name started spreading. Random people I didn’t even know would ask me to create data for them. It was stressful, but I mostly ignored them.

Oh, and my brother had a reputation at this school too. In fact, here his aura was even bigger because of the many older learners who knew him. That also meant more people knew who I was, which was nice 😹. Combine that with my tech skills, and I was very safe. Never had any bullies 💪.

During the June holiday, we went to Seshego, where my mom was staying temporarily. Beautiful small, comfortable place. It was the first time I was left in charge since she went to work and left me with Tebogo ✌️. I took the responsibility easily 😹. Unfortunately, we abused the freedom — eating around 8–10 packs of noodles per day 😂. Mom didn’t seem to care. She kept buying noodles, and we kept eating until we got sick of them. Eventually, we went back to normal food.

Mom always locked the gate when leaving. Tebogo, being stubborn, started climbing over the wall to play with kids outside. I don’t know why I let him, but I did. After a few days, I also joined him climbing 🙂‍↕️ to play soccer with the other kids. It was nice ❤️. oh and the neighbours has a beautiful girl 🤭tall girl she was probably 18 at that time so I didn't have a chance of anything weird but I did have everything required to say hello to her 😌who would have a problem with a young, quite boy saying hello and then going away n that's all I did . her Lil brother were Tebogo's age so he played with them when he jumped the fence, not sure what home language they used but their names were "ori" and "rotshidhzi" I forgot the last one's name 🤧and one day I overheard them going to the toilet and pooping then calling the others to come see the colour, then they flashed and another one pooped they went to see again 😔 at that time I believe two of them were normal poop colour and one was purple 😂(Beetroot I assume) . never knew why they did that 🙂‍↔️.

One time, my mom locked the burglar door and left with the keys. We woke up confused, like “What are we supposed to do?” 😌. But you know what we did — yes, we broke the lock 🤧,(by mistake 🙄 obviously). and Surprisingly, she didn’t even reprimand us when she got back from work 😎. Go Mom.

Also, I don’t know how, but my brother(unc)was there too 😹. He’s just always around somehow might say he was following us wherever we go . One day before church, he said, “Come here, I want to do something.” 🤭and you guessed it He wanted to relax me and my little brother’s hair. It was painful, but I looked sexy 🤭so I suffered in silence. Since that day, I’ve been relaxing my hair regularly 🫂.

Speaking of my brother 😭😹 — he was once chased by a police car.not even sure what he did - Very problematic person, that one. 

After the holidays, we went back to Indermark. School continued as usual. My friends and I all passed, and we went to Grade 9.
