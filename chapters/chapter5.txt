2022 GRADE 12

😮‍💨 THE YEAR OF THE MOST AMOUNT OF FUN I’VE EVER EXPERIENCED

Started off well with everyone from my class having had passed 💪❤️ so it was basically everyone from my class again, with an additional 2 being Moloto and Thamzahla (the two who unfortunately failed Grade 12 the previous year). So yeah, we still had the same vibe of the “C” class 💪😹. Yeah, we were basically the most problematic class but our performance overshadowed that. 🙂‍↔️🫂

A month in, it was about time to pay for the G12 sweaters 🙂‍↔️. So I was given the money by my Mom, so I went to school with it. And because I was still not that comfortable with walking around nor my destination ever being the offices, the first day I didn't go to pay 🙂‍↔️ and I ate R30... heeee the next day came and now I ate again instead of paying for the sweater 😭😂. And eventually I just kept eating the money till there was nothing left ✌️😭. But I told my Mom I had paid 😔. By that time I only had a pullover 🙂‍↔️💔 which I abused every day because I didn't like exposing my skin, so no matter how hot it is, I'd wear it. And then and then people started receiving their sweaters. It was a good thing there were problems and others didn’t get theirs, so I just gave that statement to my Mom 🙂‍↔️, which held up for a while till she now started to be like “heee Johnny you finessed me” 😂. And because apparently arguing with me isn't a good look for anyone, she just gave in and just let it be. So yeah, I didn't and don't have a Grade 12 sweater 🙂‍↔️.

Our class teacher at the time was Ma'am… 😭 Can't believe I forgot her 😭😭😭. She was the nicest teacher in the whole school and everyone liked her, even me, and that is regardless of her teaching Sepedi, which is my most hated subject. But her... and every day we would have a short prayer at her class before we left to attend our other classes because she was our class teacher. And apparently somehow she noticed that I never wore a sweater (it's always amusing and surprising when a teacher calls me or even notices I exist 😂). So for her to someday just say, “Mochebane how are you... can you help me carry this…” I was shocked 🙂‍↔️ and happy ❤️.

And this other day she gave Lesedi a brand new blazer and told him that he should find me and give it to me 😮‍💨. When he came to me and gave it I was very confused. But I accepted the blazer and wore it same time 🥲. I wanted that moment to go and thank her but I couldn't 🫠. School ended and I went home. Next day when I entered her class I wanted to go to her, but when I entered, most if not everyone was already there so I froze and hesitated. And idk if she saw, understood, or what, but she gave me a small wave (it was more of that “go away” kinda wave 😂). So I went and sat down, and we did the prayer and we left. I never got a chance to directly 🫠. But there were subtle moments, like when she was giving us our reports for June and she said, “Just keep improving to make me proud.” 🫂 (The best teacher, that one.)

One time there was an event at school 😹 that I didn't want to attend because like why would I? But I didn't have a jersey so I would have to go with just a shirt. While we were there, Ghana (one of my classmates) was busy talking nonsense, poking and touching me 😭. Idk why I couldn't contain my emotions at that time, but it annoyed me to a point where I accidentally 😂 punched him with all the strength I had. It hit him (a liver shot, not face). It created an adequately loud sound and now people are looking and Ghana is holding his stomach and me still in the angry state 😭😹. But I came to and helped him up and we laughed alongside everyone else and Ghana said, “Ehh le wena wa Kwara 😂.” Everything then continued as it was.

At that event, there was no food because it was a sort of music event. But guess what 🙂‍↔️ our class teacher gave Hope (that smart girl) some money to buy class “C” learners energy & cool drinks, and with the help of other classmates, Hope went through the school even looking for us and letting us choose the one we want 🔥✌️ (how cool is that). 😂 I think that's enough for you to understand how cool that teacher was. Now moving on to other things.

Also during the first few months of 2022, Given (aka the celebrity) had a bit of a problem with Mr Bopape, the Physics teacher 🫠. She wasn't doing all that well. I was already helping Phaladi and everyone that needed help with Physics, so I took it upon myself to help her too 😔. No one is allowed to fail Physics 😔 not when I’m around 😔✌️.

And not to brag but at that time I was kinda a genius 😎 when it came to Physics. Though rn I can’t, back then I would be able to explain things in the simplest ways, have simpler methods of solving, how to memorize definitions, etc. So it was light work helping the others. And yes, everyone did well, some slower than others but everyone still did good eventually. That included Given as well.

Apart from us already having a sort of connection, she then now added more spice to it. (NB: she comes from a very rich family — very rich.) Now she'd get me food, which I did not usually allow her to do 😂, but one or two times I'd allow it. And one day literally right in the eyes of everyone she came to me and gave me a hug and left. For a second I was just blank. When I looked back at her like wtf just happened 😹, I just walked off. (That was probably my second hug in the presence of everyone apart from that time with Kamo.) So yeah, that was that and then we got to progress to the dating stage 🫂❤️.

People were saying, “Heh heh 😹 she's not yours, heh heh 😹 this and that.” And mina I was like, “Nigga why do you care 😂.” But yeah, I got a few threats as well, but as I was always walking around with John, there was nothing anyone could do to me 😎✌️.

And one day in our Civil class (no teacher, just the class making noise and stuff) I was at the front in a way that I was blocking her way to pass. She said, “Let me pass.” And I said, “Nah 😹.” She said, “Ape ketlo betha” while pointing a finger at me. I pushed her finger away and now I point mine at her saying, “You can't do anything.” And my finger was supposed to be pointing by the chin but it dropped a bit to just by her chest. And in that moment I was like 😹, “So how do they really feel like?”

And as my finger was getting to point at her boobs, she then kept quiet, so we both knew that now this is new territory. But still 💪😌 I took all my might and I poked the boobs. (I then immediately realized there's more to life than just Physics 🙂🤝 and that something else was boobs.) Like tell me why they were so soft, smooth, bouncy, nevermind the shape and texture 😔❤️. She laughed as I let her pass 😹. And I'd get to poke them a few more times from then 😌.

And I also experimented with Kamo’s boobs ❤️😌. We were not dating but I was still close enough to her that I could poke her boobs without altercations 💪.
