2022 – Grade 12

😮‍💨 The year of the most fun I’ve ever experienced.

It started off well, with everyone from my class having passed 💪❤️. So it was basically the same class again, plus two additions: Moloto and Thamzahla (the two who unfortunately failed Grade 12 the previous year). We still had the same vibe as the “C” class 💪😹. Yeah, we were basically the most problematic class, but our performance always overshadowed that 🙂‍↔️🫂.

About a month in, it was time to pay for the Grade 12 sweaters. My mom gave me the money, but since I wasn’t comfortable walking around school or going to the office, I didn’t pay the first day. Instead, I ate R30 of it 😭😂. Next day? Same story—I ate instead of paying. Eventually, I just kept using the money until nothing was left ✌️😭.

But I told my mom I had paid 😔. At that point, I only had a pullover 🙂‍↔️💔 which I wore every single day, no matter how hot it was, because I didn’t like showing my skin. Then people started receiving their sweaters. Luckily, some people had issues with theirs, so I told my mom the same had happened to me. That excuse worked for a while until she eventually said, “Heee Johnny, you finessed me.” 😂 But since arguing with me wasn’t a good look, she just let it go. So yeah, I never had a Grade 12 sweater 🙂‍↔️.

Our class teacher at the time was Ma’am [forgotten name 😭😭😭], honestly the nicest teacher in the whole school. Everyone liked her—even me, and that’s despite her teaching Sepedi (my most hated subject). Every day, we’d have a short prayer in her class before leaving for our other lessons.

Somehow, she noticed I never wore a sweater. (It always shocked me when a teacher noticed me 😂.) One day she gave Lesedi a brand-new blazer and told him to bring it to me. When he handed it over, I was confused but accepted it—and wore it immediately 🥲. I wanted to thank her right away, but the next day when I went to, the class was already full. I froze, hesitated, and she gave me a little wave (more of a “go sit down” wave 😂). So I never got to directly thank her.

But there were moments—like when she handed out our June reports and told me, “Just keep improving to make me proud.” 🫂 Truly the best teacher.
