GOOD DAY, I AM SEAKWA JONAS MOCHEBANE AND THIS IS MY LIFE

2005, June 20 – I was born at Bochum Helen Franz Hospital. Predictions about my early years are a bit vague I can’t really remember that much, except that I lived with my grandparents in a village called Indermark, Bochum. They took care of me.

can't recall much from then so we Fast forward to 2009 age 3-4, the first memory I can recall (mostly because of a picture I saw of myself of which they confirm to be from that year). I was very short, a bit fat, and extremely quiet. In most of my early memories, I don’t remember myself talking to anyone — I was just there. At around age 4, I was no longer in Bochum. I remember being at a crèche in Seshego, a township near Polokwane. All I recall is eating porridge there. I don’t remember who I lived with or the exact place, just that it was a crèche in Seshego.

Later, I was back in Bochum (Indermark). For reference: Seshego → Polokwane = 20 minutes; Polokwane → Bochum = 1h 30m; Bochum → Indermark = 30 minutes. Life there was quiet: I woke up, ate, and slept.

In 2010, I started Grade R at age 5 at Mphokaneng Primary School. My Grade R(the teacher was ma'am mgomana not sure why n how I remember that)and Grade 1 years were peaceful and quiet (cz i don’t recall much). By Grade 2, I started attracting unwanted attention because I start getting talked to but majority of the time I would still be alone and I don't remember anyone from that class so then to grade 3 .I clearly remember in Grade 3, a classmate named Joy (probably the oldest memories of one of my current "friends" that I remember ) was given the role of class rep. While we sat on the floor, he deliberately kicked my leg, he fell, and he smiled while claiming I had tripped him(sinister Bustard🙂). Then he put me on the list of “students disturbing the class.”(I'll never forget that) n I think it was the first time I've ever been on a list of people disturbing the class cz how could I , I didn't talk to anyone but regardless we grew up to be okay .

Grade 3 was full of interactions — more than ever before. I also remember my favorite teacher, Ma’am Leshaba 🌹. She knew how to teach and somehow understood me.i also remember people saying in grade 3 we would start using pens instead of pencils 😂 that was very intimidating but it didn't happen we still used a pencil.
I even had my first friend group of four:

Dikgetho Modiba (DK) – the smartest in all my classes throughout primary.

Tumiso Tsidi – a normal guy, a bit of a crybaby.

Tumelo Moshokwa – also normal, but the closest thing I had to a real friend.

Clement Tutsa – the second or third smartest, and also a crybaby.


With them, I had my first taste of friendship.

every thing was good and I was started to understand people and try to related instead of thinking about what they are thinking 

and of which we all passed grade 3❤️.

In Grade 4 (2014), I began to understand school better and the fun of being able to answer in class. Before, I was just passing. Now, I realized why I was there and got serious.that might also been because of Our class teacher, Ma’am Masekela, the most feared woman in school😅. But I held my own, often answering so much that she’d tell me to put my hand down to give others a chance. Sometimes no one else would answer, and she’d flog the whole class — except me 🤗.

My friends and I also created a money pool: each day we’d give one member R5. That meant when it was your turn, you got R20 — was a lot back then. Around this time, I also started watching Dragon Ball on SABC 2 at 17:00. School ran from 7:45 to 16:00, with a long break (10:30–11:30) and a short break (13:45–14:15). Walking home took around 10 minutes if I walked fast, 20 minutes if I strolled. Since there was a big bridge between my side of home and the school, I usually went straight home quickly to catch Dragon Ball.

By 16:20 I’d arrive home, ask my grandpa for food, and wait for 17:00(didn't eat I waited for dragon ball to start and then I start eating 😌to enjoy both). My grandpa was the best cook by the way 😎.and the best in general He always woke me up, got water ready, prepared snacks, and made sure I bathed. My routine was simple: wake up, school, home, food, anime, sleep. .. it's weird how I don't have any memories of Tebogo 🤔or maybe he wasn't born yet? I don't even remember his as a baby feels like he just pop out of nowhere one day and was my Lil brother 🙂... anyway 

At school, thanks to my friends, I was talking more(to them 🙂‍↔️I still didn't talk to anyone else). DK was loved for being smart n just the natural favourite in all aspects, Clement was smart and cute (despite being a crybaby), Tumelo was cool and loved by the girls, Tumiso was funny, and me — I was just there 🤗. we had fun times , playing together laughing together or at Clement and tumiso if they started to cry for unrealistic reasons 😹 and we all ended up passing grade 4.

Grade 5 (2015) felt similar to 2014 nothing extra happen and I really can't recall anything except for one incident with the new teacher when he wanted to read a  . We all passed and went to Grade 6 (2016). That’s when I started remembering Tebogo more clearly at school I don't know if he wasn't there at the time before but all my memories of him started there(he always finished his money on the first break even though they were giving food and on the last brean he'd come to me asking for money to buy something 😹). I also noticed my grade number always matched the year’s last digit (Grade 6 in 2016, Grade 7 in 2017), which motivated me to keep passing.

In Grade 6, the boys and I still did everything together: eating, playing soccer, having fun. I also remember a strange scandal involving Tebogo , normally when we go home we'd walk with some "friends"that also lived on our side I would normally be in the front and they'll be playing around in the back  on that random day I heard some commotion, didn't care much but I looked back And I saw that the target was Tebogo . definitely wasn't going to let that happen so I went back stood infront of them and asked what was up.

Apparently they wanted Tebogo to taste their artchar(yeah Weird) n I said no he's not tasting it and they kept insisting on it so I ended up spilling it over and I took Tebogo and left , they were behind us shouting that I need to pay them back for it I just ignored them till we got home . I thought everything was over then heard my grandpa talking with some people outside, those "friends" came to my grandpa demanding money.and my grandpa is a very respected mam and He didn’t tolerate disrespect.(you may blame my memory but from there I don't remember much all I know is that they left).the next day At school, I was called to the office by Mr. Marenagae, the most feared male teacher and to my surprise my grandpa was there too and they asked me to explain everything which I did and then after they called those "friends" with Mr marenagae on the case they eventually spilled the truth It turned out the “friends” found that artchar on the road and they wanted Tebogo to eat it as some sort of "prank"(yep very sinister) but anyway they were flogged😮‍💨.and I remember the main character in all of this which was a girl named Mecheal Mai — and funny enough, her content  pops up quite frequently on my Facebook and tik tok.but anyway.. 

..We all passed to Grade 7 (2017). actually, I couldn’t get my report because I lost some books so for a few days of January 2017 I was still in grade 6 😹.but After my grandparents paid for them, I was then able to go to the grade 7 class. and Surprisingly Tumelo had saved me a seat(we sat in desks of 2). Grade 7 was interesting because of the older “cool guys”:

1. Kamo Mapaya

2. Benjamin Petlo (Benji)

3. France Madidha


Kamo and Benji were like lions competing for the top sit in the school.And You had to choose sides.{We got food in bins so one person in a class would need to take the job of serving the other learners} If you were on Kamo’s side and he didn’t come to school, Benji’s side wouldn’t let you eat (and vice versa)😹you'd just suffer. They fought sometimes but also laughed together. Once, they even had a drifting competition with bikes thou🙂‍↔️. ohh and this other time, Madidha(3rd) had both Kamo and Benji by their necks I don't know what the build up was but when I got there that's what I saw —he then Shaked them a bit while still holding their necks and Kamo didn't like this and you want to know how I know he didn't like it 😹 because Kamo gave him the 3 fastest , loudest and hardest slaps I've ever seen😹.and Benji was just there aura farming quite and stuff just looking into madidha's eyes and eventually that was broken up cz what was the point.

I sided with Benji because he also lived by the side of the bridge I was at , but Kamo also respected me and at first I thought I was just that guy😎 then I later found out it was bcz of my brother ✊he left quite a reputation. and speaking about him 😹one day in our bed room we were playing wrestling very very until he threw me in the air and I landed badly on my arm and yes you guessed it i had broken my arm 🤧 I don't remember the pain or much but I do know I went to the hospital and I had a cast for like 6 months but it healed and we played wrestling again ✌️😹

at school I remember 😭idk how but I somehow confused female and male during my natural sciences test and the teacher was like "there people who still don't know what are females and what are males" I remember her locking eyes with me for a brief moment, thou she didn't rat me out 😹💪. good teacher that one . n my worst subject in grade 7 would have to be EMS I hated that with my my heart but it was hard to hate it fully cz it was taught by my favourite teacher 😔so I learned to comply 

Grade 7 was also when my first “love complication” happened. On the last day of school, DK and the others brought a girl who said she had a crush on me.i was just there wondering wtf is going on and because it was the last day of school People could be loud n stuff do they cheered, of which I panicked n😔 I just left her there. I never saw her again because we were moving on to high school, and I didn’t even have a phone 😮‍💨 I feel sad for her 🥲she was a sweet nice quiet girl much like me 😹I mean the quite part .but it is what it is , her name jonia ramapala and after typing that 😹I see if you switch "i" and "a"'s positions and replace "i" with "s" with would spell Jonas 😹.... Wild 

but yeah I went home got to experience a few weeks of freedom of just waking up to my grandpa's food and watching anime on TV and then sleeping . then come the time to get my report which my grandpa went 😹and tell me why when she come back here had a serious face passing me and throwing the report on the table telling me I failed and then leaving the room 😭cz I knew I couldn't have failed,😂but again I've never seen my grandpa play like that so I was scared and confused so I went to open the report and it said I passed and he came back smiling and laughing 😹. that was A very nice moment ❤️😤😂 regardless of it being scary and it was decided that my high school will be marumofase high school slightly close than the primary but still on the other side of the bridge 💖
