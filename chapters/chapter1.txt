GOOD DAY, I AM SEAKWA JONAS MOCHEBANE AND THIS IS MY LIFE

2005, JUNE 20: I was born at Bochum Helen France Hospital. Predictions about my early years are things I can‚Äôt really remember. I lived with my grandparents in Bochum, in a village called Indermark, and they took care of me alongside my mother, the oldest of the grandparents' siblings.

Fast forward to 2009, the first memory I can recall (this is possible because of a picture I saw of myself‚ÄîI was very short, a bit chubby, and extremely quiet throughout all my early memories; I don‚Äôt recall talking to anyone in most cases, I was just there). At 3 years old, I was no longer in Bochum. I remember being at a creche in Seshego, a neighboring township from Polokwane. All I recall is eating porridge at that creche; I can‚Äôt remember exactly who I was living with or the precise location‚Äîjust that it was a creche in Seshego.

From there, the next memory takes me back to Bochum (Indermark). (Seshego to Polokwane is 20 minutes, Polokwane to Bochum is 1 hour 30 minutes, Bochum to Indermark is 30 minutes.) I lived a fairly quiet life‚Äîso quiet that I hardly remember anything happening. I would wake up, eat, and sleep.

I started Grade R in 2010 at the age of 5 (not 15) at Mphokaneng Primary School. I had a peaceful and quiet Grade R and Grade 1 (I assume, as I don‚Äôt recall much from those grades). In Grade 2, I began attracting some unwanted attention. I strongly remember that in Grade 3, a classmate was given the role of class rep. While we were sitting on the floor, he deliberately kicked my leg and I fell. He was smiling and saying he tripped me, and I ended up on the list of students disturbing the class. His name was Joy‚Äîthe oldest name I can remember.

Grade 3 was filled with the most interactions I‚Äôd ever had. I also remember the teacher‚Äîshe was my favorite: Ma‚Äôam Leshaba üåπ. She knew how to teach and somehow understood me. I was also part of a friend group of four:

Dikgetho Modiba (DK): The smartest person in all my classes through primary school.

Tumiso Tsidi: A normal guy, a bit of a crybaby.

Tumelo Moshokwa: Also normal; I was quite attached to him. I‚Äôd say he was the closest thing I had to a friend at that time.

Clement Tutsa: The second or third smartest guy in my classes, also a crybaby.


With them, I started to experience my first taste of life. It was a nice group. We all passed to Grade 4, where I began to understand education and the purpose of school. In previous grades, I was just passing, but now I started taking it seriously. I was considered serious mainly because the class teacher, Ma‚Äôam Masekela, was the most feared female teacher in the school. Nonetheless, I kept up with DK and Clement so well that the teacher would say, ‚ÄúNo, put your hands down, you‚Äôve answered enough, let others answer.‚Äù When this happened, no one else would raise their hands except me. ü§ó

Other things from Grade 4 (2014) I remember include:

My friend group created a sort of money pool where each day, we would give one person 5 Rands. Considering this would be 20 Rands when it was your turn, it was a lot of money at the time.

I also started watching Dragon Ball on SABC at 17:00. My school started at 7:45 and ended at 16:00, with two breaks: a long one from 10:30 to 11:30 and a short one from 13:45 to 14:15.


I walked from home to school in about 10 minutes if I walked seriously; otherwise, 20 minutes if I strolled. Considering there‚Äôs a big bridge between my home and school, I preferred to head straight home to catch Dragon Ball at 17:00. On average, I arrived home at 16:20, and by 16:50, I would ask my grandpa for food (my grandpa is the best at making food üòé). If I wasn‚Äôt eating, I would just sit and wait for 17:00 to enjoy the show.

At that age, I don‚Äôt remember much else. My grandpa would wake me up, get water ready, prepare snacks, I would bathe, eat, and watch TV. The loop was simple: wake up, school, come home, get food, watch Dragon Ball.

At school, it was a bit more active because I got to talk to more people. In my friend group:

DK was smart and loved by everyone.

Clement was smart, cute, and a crybaby, also loved.

Tumelo was cool and popular with the ladies.

Tumiso was funny and loved.

I was just there ü§ó.


We all passed Grade 4 and moved on to Grade 5. I don‚Äôt remember much from 2015, so I assume it was similar to 2014, both at school and at home. We all passed to Grade 6, which was another step forward.
