GOOD DAY, I AM SEAKWA JONAS MOCHEBANE AND THIS IS MY LIFE

2005, June 20 – I was born at Bochum Helen Franz Hospital. Predictions about my early years I can’t really remember, except that I lived with my grandparents in a village called Indermark, Bochum. They took care of me alongside my mother, the oldest of the siblings.

Fast forward to 2009, the first memory I can recall (mostly because of a picture I saw of myself). I was very short, a bit fat, and extremely quiet. In most of my early memories, I don’t remember myself talking to anyone — I was just there. At around age 3, I was no longer in Bochum. I remember being at a crèche in Seshego, a township near Polokwane. All I recall is eating porridge there. I don’t remember who I lived with or the exact place, just that it was a crèche in Seshego.

Later, I was back in Bochum (Indermark). For reference: Seshego → Polokwane = 20 minutes; Polokwane → Bochum = 1h 30m; Bochum → Indermark = 30 minutes. Life there was quiet: I woke up, ate, and slept.

In 2010, I started Grade R at age 5 at Mphokaneng Primary School. My Grade R and Grade 1 years were peaceful and quiet (I don’t recall much). By Grade 2, I started attracting unwanted attention. I clearly remember in Grade 3, a classmate named Joy (probably the first name I still remember) was given the role of class rep. While we sat on the floor, he deliberately kicked my leg, I fell, and he smiled while claiming I had tripped him. That put me on the list of “students disturbing the class.”

Grade 3 was full of interactions — more than ever before. I also remember my favorite teacher, Ma’am Leshaba 🌹. She knew how to teach and somehow understood me. I even had my first friend group of four:

Dikgetho Modiba (DK) – the smartest in all my classes throughout primary.

Tumiso Tsidi – a normal guy, a bit of a crybaby.

Tumelo Moshokwa – also normal, but the closest thing I had to a real friend.

Clement Tutsa – the second or third smartest, and also a crybaby.


With them, I had my first taste of friendship.

In Grade 4 (2014), I began to understand school better. Before, I was just passing. Now, I realized why I was there and got serious. Our class teacher, Ma’am Masekela, was the most feared woman in school. But I held my own, often answering so much that she’d tell me to put my hand down to give others a chance. Sometimes no one else would answer, and she’d flog the whole class — except me 🤗.

My friends and I also created a money pool: each day we’d give one member R5. That meant when it was your turn, you got R20 — a lot back then. Around this time, I also started watching Dragon Ball on SABC at 17:00. School ran from 7:45 to 16:00, with a long break (10:30–11:30) and a short break (13:45–14:15). Walking home took 10 minutes if I walked fast, 20 if I strolled. Since there was a big bridge, I usually went straight home quickly to catch Dragon Ball.

By 16:20 I’d arrive home, ask my grandpa for food, and wait for 17:00. My grandpa was the best cook 😎. He always woke me up, got water ready, prepared snacks, and made sure I bathed. My routine was simple: wake up, school, home, food, anime, sleep.

At school, thanks to my friends, I was talking more. DK was loved for being smart, Clement was smart and cute (despite being a crybaby), Tumelo was cool and loved by the girls, Tumiso was funny, and me — I was just there 🤗.

Grade 5 (2015) felt similar to 2014. We all passed and went to Grade 6 (2016). That’s when I started remembering Tebogo more clearly at school. Around then, I also noticed the grade number matched the year’s last digit (Grade 6 in 2016, Grade 7 in 2017), which motivated me to keep passing.

In Grade 6, the boys and I still did everything together: eating, playing soccer, having fun. I also remember a strange scandal involving Tebogo. Some “friends” tried to prank him by making him eat atchar they’d found on the ground. I stood up for him, knocked the atchar over, and refused to let him eat it. Later, those friends even came to my grandpa demanding money. He didn’t tolerate disrespect. At school, I was called to the office by Mr. Marenagae, the most feared male teacher. It turned out the “friends” admitted the prank, and they were flogged. The ringleader was a girl named Mecheal Mai — funny enough, her content still pops up on Facebook.

We all passed to Grade 7 (2017). At first, I couldn’t get my report because I lost some books. After my grandparents paid for them, I joined my class. Tumelo had saved me a seat. Grade 7 was interesting because of the older “cool guys”:

1. Kamo Mapaya


2. Benjamin Petlo (Benji)


3. France Madidha



Kamo and Benji were like lions competing for dominance. You had to choose sides. If you were on Kamo’s side and he didn’t come, Benji’s side wouldn’t let you eat (and vice versa). They fought sometimes but also laughed together. Once, they even had a drifting competition with bikes. Another time, Madidha tried grabbing both Kamo and Benji by the neck — but Kamo slapped him so hard I’ll never forget it 😹. I sided with Benji because he lived near me, but Kamo also respected me. Later I found out it was because my older brother had left a good reputation at school.

Grade 7 was also when my first “love complication” happened. On the last day of school, DK and the others brought a girl who said she had a crush on me. People cheered, and I panicked — I just left her there. I never saw her again because we were moving on to high school, and I didn’t even have a phone 😮‍💨.

After that, we all passed Grade 7 and went to Marumofase High School, Grade 8 (2018).
