2019 GRADE 9 CLASS A

🥲 This had a sad start as I found out that Tumiso wasn't able to pass, 😮‍💨 but yeah it is what it is and again we got split. I was again in 9A with Anathi and all his gang as well as DK and Clement 🥲. Tumelo was unfortunately placed in 9B, so yeah we learned to accept that and we continued with our lives.

Anyway, in this year I started to have confidence in my tech capabilities, so I started to test on people. I would play songs on other people's phones 😗, make their phones flash colors and other stuff — it was nice. Then my brother also noticed (NB: he likes money, everything he does is about getting money), so he asked me if I could use my capabilities in a way that would get us some cash. I obviously said no ’cause I didn't want the job nor was I enthusiastic about the whole thing, though he did keep insisting and I kept delaying. Apart from that, I also started a Facebook page called “Destroyers Legion” 🤭 (currently “DTech Destroyers Legion”)(press 👉 https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100054886954297 ) and it was gaining followers. For my first page it was doing quite well — I was able to get around 1000 followers in a few months ✌️🙂‍↔️ specifically focusing on free data.

On the school side, I had a lot of problems in Grade 9 ’cause a lot of the teachers knew my grandpa, mom, uncle, aunty, and brother. So yeah, every day the word “Mochebane” would be said quite a few times. One time we had a technology project of building a crane, which I had my brother do for me, and he created the literal perfect crane — the best possible thing that could be built with wires. It was so good that the teacher had previously given another student 96% for his crane, but because of how much better this one was, they had to take that percentage down so mine could be 98% 😎 (it couldn’t be 100%). It was a very nice moment for me 🤧. Then came another activity for LO where we had to dance, and you should have seen me abusing the Gwaragwara 😭😂. Nonetheless, that was that.

Again, while sitting in class with Anathi, I was eavesdropping on his conversation with the girl behind us and they were talking about sex and stuff. In my mind (way too pure) I was thinking that they were just making lies and trying to sound cool and grown up, ’cause wtf do you mean that learners in Grade 9 have sex 🙄. So yeah, they were talking about that and at one point the girl said, “Do you know that we have two holes down there?” and my body was like, mmmm, don’t even care, didn’t even flinch — but in my mind I was like: “huh?”, “what?”, “how?”, “why?” Then in my mind I  said there’s no way 😭 what would the other hole be for? And then some other boy said, “Yeah, we know” 😭. I’m like, you and who? (in my mind). Then it was a fact that they really did have two holes, and for weeks and months I was confused and asking myself what’s really going on down there… and I just left it at that 😔.

😹 Oh, and after a few weeks of that, another girl asked me if I was a virgin. I didn’t know anything about what that was. All I knew is that it means that girls had or didn’t have sex yet 😭. Because I never heard it being asked to a boy, I thought that only girls could be virgins (or at least that was their term). So I thought she was playing with me or something, so I said no, I’m not a virgin 😔. I said that with a straight face and she froze for a bit, then laughed and left 😹. I always remember that. And it’s the same girl that also one day said I looked very cute, and again I just mized 😮‍💨. Didn’t understand relationships then, nor did I care or need one.

Life was good, I was passing, was on good terms with everyone, I had some sort of presence, and that was that. And at that time, because of the position of the high school, we mostly went through the bridge (not over it — simply just drawing a straight line and going in the bridge and out was the fastest way to that school, rather than first going in the opposite direction to then be able to cross over the bridge and then head in the direction of the school). So because of the dangers of that, the learners living on my side were issued two buses that would take us home and to school using the long way 💪🤭. And my house was on the corner of the main road, so I basically got off right at my house. During this time I got to know Tshiamo because  he would also gets off where I got off. He was very interested in those “hacking” stuff so we got to be friends. For the very first time in my life, I had a friend close to where I stayed (he lived a few houses down from me). And again this was the very first time I went out of the house not because of school, not going to the shop ,but because I was going to be with a friend 😹. But I could only go as far as my house’s corner — ain’t no way I’m going any further than that. Tshiamo didn’t have a problem, so he would come to my corner and we would just be there. Because of how talkative he is and because my corner was literally on the main road of my village, almost every 3–8 people would simply come by to greet and talk to Tshiamo, and sometimes it’d be people coming to talk to me (which was weird). But that’s how I got to know more people in my side of the village — e.g. Desmond, a well-mannered person I liked him, calm and decisive; Tshego, a very loud straightforward guy, I had no issues with him; Blue, one of the tough bully types but again I was on very good terms, so whenever he was around it was like I had a bodyguard. Those were the main people, and many others I got to in a way befriend — not to forget the girls 😅 I also got to befriend and be able to greet a few on my own. Unfortunately, I did not like talking with girls — and trust me when I say they talked 😮‍💨🤧.

Nonetheless, because of the new friends, a repeat of Grade 7 happened 😹. Somehow they decided that I loved this one other girl and that girl also decided that for some reason she loved me as well. So now it was like I had the whole village trying to make me confess my love to her 😎. Obviously I just ran away and was never to be seen 🫠. But they caught me one day when I had to go to the shop. When I returned, they stopped me and shoved me to where that girl was 😔 and we were just there. Now, for some reason, I decided let me give this a try 😂 so I said, “Do you love me?” She said yes, and I said, “Okay, love you too” and I left 🙂‍↔️. We talked on Facebook, met up again, talked awkwardly, and went home. We did that like 3 times without even getting a hug (a hug was the only thing I considered that couples could give each other, especially at that age). Nonetheless, I grew bored and just stopped talking to her 🙂‍↔️. Some might say am having an affair with you on her… 🙂‍↔️ joking obviously ❤️. But yes, that was that.

With that I got into talking stages (as you people call it) with a few girls. I recall Pabi, a very short girl who looked like my lil sister when I was with her (no kiss, no hug, no anything — just playing with the I love you phrase), and Mosima, way taller, also no nothing at that point, just playing with the I love you phrase. So yeah, I started experimenting with relationships, which was good ’cause I started to understand that even if I prefer to be alone, having someone around is also a good thing ❤️. So that played out for a while.

Ohh yeah, we had a shop called Margot 😹 — sold the best vetkoeks in the whole area, and the bus stop in the morning was literally by their door, so we would buy our money’s worth 🤭. The joy of warm vetkoeks in cold weather in the comfort of a bus (FYI there were two buses: one very new and one very old 😹. The new one had everything — comfortable, warmth, everything).

And also during this year would be the first time I got an epileptic seizure attack. The first time it happened I don't remember anything (word is I left my class 9A and went to 9B, climbed a desk and then fell/passed out) — yeah, imagine 😹. Again, I did mention that I’m technically a zombie for a few seconds before I actually pass out, so I do things that I literally won’t remember doing during that time. When I came to.....I actually remember vague memories of being carried to the office, then it went black again, and I came to I was at the clinic bed (around 5 minutes’ drive from school) ✌️😎. I went home the same day, took a long rest, and when I woke up I was okay 💪. But you know parents — I was still taken for a check-up at Helen Franz. I stayed a night ’cause they didn’t know what was going on, then I was sent to Pietermaritzburg hospital where they also ran tests and stuff 🤧. I was also sent to another place I don’t know or remember, but I went there for a few hours. Then after that I went back home and I did regular checkups at Helen Franz, getting my meds every month 🤧 etc.

But yes, it happened again 🙂‍↔️ but at home this time 😂. Woke up to a huge bump on my head. This time they were more aware of my condition and didn’t panic or pour water to try wake me up. They just took off my shirt and laid me down with proper air ventilation, and I came to in a few minutes 🫂. Rested, and then I was back to normal and everything was calm from then… same at school, same with my friends.

this is also the year I issue D-TECH which was previously destroyers legion the destroyer part coming from the anime Dragon ball's character called Lord beruus the destroyer, a very powerful God that was incharge of the 7th universe . so now it was destroyers tech it sounded cool so my young mind kept it for a while then at a later date  as I progressed I was wondering how that made sense 😮‍💨so I decided to change it but I still wanted to been the D-TECH title so I decided on Dynamic TECH which is much more understandable as all I do is use the current available tech to create free And useful resources for the general public that's the main idea of everything I do (hence you see everything Is free as I only gain from ads if I can ) so through our the years I kept building my name and brand all over platform like Telegrm, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, tik Tok , discord and YouTube 
slowly but surely ❤️...👍

So yeah, and I passed to Grade 10 😚
